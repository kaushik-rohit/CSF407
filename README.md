## **ABOUT**

To be updated.


## **DEPENDENCIES**
1. The install.sh script installs all the required dependencies for the project, but the down-side is it works only for Ubuntu. You can figure out the required dependencies by looking at the install.sh script.

2. The projects make use of following libraries:
     * **OpenAI gym**
     * **gym-ple**
     * **PyGame-Learning-Environment**
     
### **Installating on Ubuntu Using Script**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
source ENV/bin/activate
python example.py # Test if installation was successfull
```
_For any further run, you will just need to activate the ENV virtual environment using ``` source ENV/bin/activate ``` and run learning algos for different games._
